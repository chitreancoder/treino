# 6-Week CrossFit Style Training Program

## Fat Loss + Strength Maintenance Cycle

### Athlete Profile
- **Current Bodyweight:** 84 kg
- **Daily Caloric Intake:** 1600-1800 kcal
- **Current Lifts:**
  - Snatch: 80 kg
  - Clean & Jerk: 100 kg
  - Deadlift: 140 kg
  - Back Squat: 140 kg
  - Bench Press: 95 kg
- **Training Frequency:** 6 days/week, 50-65 minutes per session
- **Goal:** Reduce weight without losing strength
- **Equipment:** Barbell, squat racks, KBs (4-24 kg), DBs, sled, trap bar, bike, rower, ski, boxes (20", 24", 30"), open space, sandbags (20-50 lb), conventional gym machines

---

## WOD Philosophy
- 60% barbell-heavy WODs, 40% KB/sandbag/DB WODs
- Mix and match modalities freely
- ZERO WOD REPEATS week-to-week (every WOD is unique)
- All WODs confined to functional area (no long cardio machine-only work)
- Intensity: ~70-80% effort to maintain recovery across 6 days

## Strength Progression

| Week | Intensity | Sets | Reps | Focus |
|------|-----------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | 70-80% 1RM | 4 | 5-8 | Foundation |
| 2 | 75-80% 1RM | 4 | 5-6 | Volume increase |
| 3 | 75-85% 1RM | 4 | 3-5 | Mixed ranges |
| 4 | 75-85% 1RM | 3-4 | Varies | Higher density |
| 5 | 80-85% 1RM | 3 | 2-3 | Peak strength |
| 6 | 90-95% 1RM | Singles | Testing | Assessment |

---

## WOD Progression

| Week | Duration | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | 10-15 min | Standard rep schemes, moderate loads |
| 2 | 12-18 min | Increased volume, slightly heavier loads |
| 3 | 11-20 min | Varied rep schemes, more barbell emphasis |
| 4 | 9-22 min | Shorter chippers, higher density |
| 5 | 10-20 min | Longer windows, mixed modalities, peak intensity |
| 6 | Testing | Benchmarking, repeat WODs for comparison |

## Nutrition & Recovery

### Caloric Intake: 1600-1800 kcal/day
- Creates moderate deficit (~500 kcal/day below maintenance)
- Expected fat loss: ~0.5-1 lb per week (sustainable)

### Protein Priority: 140-170g protein/day (1.7-2.0g per kg)
- Preserves muscle mass during deficit
- Supports recovery between sessions

### Carbs & Fats: Distribute remaining ~1000-1200 kcal
- **Higher carbs** on heavy strength days (Days 1, 2, 4)
- **Lower carbs** on light/WOD days (Days 3, 5, 6) if needed
- Keep fats at ~0.8-1.0g per kg (~65-85g/day)

### Hydration
- 3-4 liters of water daily minimum
- More on training days

### Sleep
- 7-9 hours per night (critical for recovery at this volume and deficit)

---

## Coaching Cues

### Recovery Management
- If a day feels extra hard, reduce WOD intensity by 10-15% (scale loads or reps)
- Track how you feel: energy levels, sleep quality, hunger
- If strength isn't improving week-to-week, dial back WOD volume slightly
- Soreness is okay; pain is not (distinguish between the two)

### Tracking Progress
- Write down all lifts and reps for each strength session
- Track WOD scores: rounds/reps completed or time to finish
- Week 6 benchmarks should show clear improvement from Week 1
- Expected improvements: +5-10 kg on main lifts, +1-2 rounds on similar WODs

### Movement Quality
- Never sacrifice form for load or speed
- If you're failing reps, reduce weight slightly
- Video yourself on complex movements (snatches, cleans, C&Js)
- Mobility work: 10 min daily (shoulder dislocates, pigeon stretch, couch stretch)

### Adjustments
- **Too easy:** Add load (+2.5-5 kg on strength), reduce rest by 15-30 seconds on WODs
- **Too hard:** Reduce load (-2.5-5 kg), add rest by 15-30 seconds, drop reps by 2-3
- **Energy is low:** Check sleep, calories, and stress; may need a full rest day

---

## Expected Outcomes by Week 6

- **Weight:** -3-6 kg (mostly fat, minimal muscle loss due to high protein + heavy lifting)
- **Strength:** Maintain or slightly improve main lifts (back squat, deadlift, bench, C&J, snatch)
- **Work Capacity:** Significant improvement in WOD performance (more rounds, faster times)
- **Energy & Body Composition:** Visible fat loss, maintained or improved muscle definition

---

## What Makes Each WOD Unique
- Different time domains: 8 min AMRAP vs. 12 min AMRAP vs. EMOM vs. Chipper
- Different rep schemes: 10/10/10 vs. 15/20/25 vs. ascending ladder
- Different movement patterns: Barbell cleans vs. sandbag cleans vs. DB snatches
- Different modalities: KBs, sandbags, DBs, barbell, sled, row, ski, bike
- Different equipment combinations: Always mixing to avoid boredom and stimulus adaptation

---

## After This Cycle
Repeat with new WOD variations, heavier loads (+5-10 kg), or longer time caps to continue progress.
